## Printing something on screen can be done by two commands
# 1. echo
# 2. printf

# printf will have more syntaxes to deal with and however echo is more descriptive and yet does all the things that printf does.

## Syntax: echo <MESSAGE TO PRINT >

echo Hello World Suresh
## Syntax for color or new lines : echo -e "MESSAGE\n\t\e"

# echo -e option do need message to be quoted (Either single or double quotes) | (With out quotes also works but with more syntaxing)

# Print Multiple Lines (\n), Some tab space (\t)

echo -e Hello World,\n\tWelcome
